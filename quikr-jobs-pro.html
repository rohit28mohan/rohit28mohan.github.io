          <p>Quikr Jobs Pro is a Application tracking tool that recruiters(consultants) and employers(HR) can use to screen, process and hire candidates. Basically post onboarding companies/HR to the platform, they can start posting their job requirements to the platform.<br><br> Then the recruiters/consultant can look at the roles and suggest candidates from their sources who would fit the role. So the platform enables HR and recruiters to streamline the process and allow companies to look from a larger pool of candidates.</p>

          <h4>About the project</h4>
          <p>Quikr Jobs Pro is primarily an application tracking tool which . My <b>role in the project</b> was to improve the experience for the employers so that they can make a <b>quick decision on the candidiate</b> thereby allowing recruiter/consultant to either search for more relevant candidate or move to other open roles. The problem posted mainly by recruiters was a high turn around time for their candidates in the initial stages for screening.</p>
          <p>Also to mention their were certain constraints on the number of candidates that can be forwarded for any role by any consultant as they would end up spamming the HR/employer with irrelevant candidates. Also there caps on number of open roles that a consultant can apply simultaneously so that there can be hygiene in the system and also consultant can choose wisely. Recruiters pickup roles based on <b>closing fee and interest by other recruiters/consultants</b> that is shown in the active jobs dashboard.</p>

        <h3>Understanding employers workflow and painpoints</h3>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 left">
          <p class="left">Post bringing up the HR/employers on board the system there was a hesistancy by the employers. The main issue was that post the submission of candidate by the system it took a <b>lot of time</b> for a decision to be made on the candidate. This was really irritating for the recriters as they either became <b>blocked</b> on other open positions due to the system constraints.
          <p>The first part of the process was to conduct interviews with the employers and recruiters. I was able to understant their work, their process and identify issues with the whole scouting and interview process. </p>
          <br><br>
          <h4>Irrelevant candidates suggested for high profile jobs</h4>
          <p>A general complaint by the employers were that many candidates being forwarded didn't meet their basic standards. Normally these jobs had the biggest payout and hence the highest interest, many recruiters would focus on these jobs alone and leave other jobs on the system.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Unifying the experience </h4>
          <p>A simple glance over the resume would allow the employers to judge whether the candidate is suitable or not. The current viewing experience for the resume was broken where one would need to switch back and forth in the application and resume.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Defining clear objectives and scope</h4>
          <p>
            After the research, I had better persepective to solve the user isssues and improve the experience both for the employer and recruiters.
          </p>
            <ul class="pointers">
              <li><b>Unify the experience</b> for the employers to avoid multiple back and forth</li>
              <li><b>Improve communication</b> b/w employer and consultant</li>
              <li>Add system constraints to ensure <b>better candidate matching</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Apart from this I was asked to ensure this new work flow would be scalable to accomodate new requirements like customized hiring process for the employer and user accounts for the employers.</p>

          <h4>Ensuring better communication</h4>
          <p>After our initial discussion and prioritizing pain points for both the employers &amp; consultant , I started preparing workflows to facilitate candidate's process. I worked on multiple ideas and rather that limiting to design I explored ideas such as profile match(ML) and integration in clients systems for seamless experience.</p>
          <p> I had to validate these ideas with the tech and product team for feasibility and urgency. Some were good to have and some even though promising were invalidated due to time constraints.</p>

          <h3>Crafting the Final flow</h3>
          <p>Post the ideation and finalizing the flow I started to work on the User Interface. As we were a part of Quikr eco-system many key elements were inherited directly from there. Apart from that many design elements were heavily inspired from material design.</p><br>
        
          <p> Colors in Jobs pro signified the current status of the application hence at many places in the UI the simple header, button colors were signified with same. But the general idea was to have a clean interface to facilitate easy viewing anf working experience.</p><br>
          <p>A lot of taxonomy and language was discussed with internal HR to ensure the system talks in the sam e langage as employers and recruiters.</p>
