              <p> I led the design effort in the project, trying to create an experience a unique shopping experience for the user. Also one of the key tasks was to ensure that we build up trust within users and educate them about various features like Cash on Delivery, returns and exchange which first time users find difficult.</p>
              <p>I was also working as a <strong>SPOC</strong> for the project where I was having discussions with technology team, content team, category team as well as marketing team to implement the design smoothly and also have contsant feedback with other stakeholders.</p>
              <h3>Design Process</h3>
              <p>We didn't have the budget or time to have a detailed research but still I did minor <strong class="nowrap">user research</strong> to make iterative changes in the design.</p>
              <p>After the user research, I started conceptualizing rough mocks using <strong>paper prototypes</strong> and tested them within team. Finally I created <strong>wireframes </strong> for the entire shop. Apart from product pages and checkout, I also worked on flows like returns, exchange to ensure an easy &amp; experience for users.</p>
              <p>As Next already had a <strong>visual design theme(style guide)</strong> for print which I translated into web. Also gave feedback to content team for product images, graphic banners etc. which were further outsourced.</p>

              <h3>User Research Methodology</h3>
              <p>User research was done primarily by me in a agile manner. We didn't have an extensive study of the earlier shop, but we did an <strong>Heuristic evaluation</strong> of the existing shop.</p>
              <p>I also asked other designers to evaluate the UI for the existing shop to cover more issues. We limited des</p>

                <li>
                <h5>Information gathering</h5>
                  <p>I started with a literature review and collected data about features and offering from various other competetiors such as <i>Flipkart, Snapdeal</i> &amp; other Indian sites. Apart from that also looked at other resources (Comet and Bestbuy) having a similar model like Next with offline and online presence.</p>
                  <p>Also I was in constant discussion with the category manages, people with order management team and customer care to collect information about issues user face.</p>

                  <h5>Surveys</h5>
                  <p>Conducted survey with users and stakeholders to find specific issues with the existing shop. The survey was a different for shoppers and stakeholders where we wanted to see perception of stakeholders and users.</p>

                  <p>Persona helps to educate team members and stakeholders of the motivations behind the design. They represnt a fictional user based upon our user research. </p>

                    Gain insighst about user needs, expectation and capability
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Created multiple persona as per the user research and literature review. We revisited the persona to validate the design iterations. Also it provided insights for the checkout as well.</p>

              <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
              <p>Normally ecommerce shops have a defined structure of list pages, details pages, cart and checkout. We decided to use short multi-step checkout rather than one-page checkout which although simple and short but mis guides users. Tested quick mocks of <strong>one page checkout versus multi step checkout</strong> with users. Also Next have a higher profile of users belonging Tier-II Indian cities are not comfortable currently with more prevalent in many Indian ecommerce checkout.</p>
              <p>Also planned <strong>buying guide</strong> for informing users about how to select electrical appliances as per their needs.</p>
              <p>Also added <strong>brand pages</strong> to help users educate about certain brands that are although well known but might not be much well known to user. Also it helped build trust when users can know details about the brand. It also had contact details, customer care numbers to establish trust.</p>

              <h3>Categorization &amp; Sub-categorization</h3>
              
              <p>Had a dicussion and conducted small design tests to assign most logical categorization for sub categorization. Had to discuss with various category managers to make sure that final structure satisfies business goals.</p>

              <p>I have attached a category structure that I used as per the initial plan. But we extened the categories further when we added some more.</p>

              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <p>Initially I started with paper prototypes which was constantly validated with the Persona. Apart from usual checkout flow, I designed flows for <strong>returns/exchange</strong> as well.</p>
              <p>One of the key challenges was the <strong>offline, online intergration</strong> where user can check whether any product is available at the nearest store as well. Designed it in a phased wise manner where initially the user can get the details but submitting a request on a prouduct page. But also create a mock where user can check its availability at the nearest store (we didn't implement this due to technical constraint).</p>
              <p>Designed a store locator where user can locate store in his/her city.</p>
              <p>I created an <strong>Interaction Design Document</strong> which showcased how a user will be navigated within a particular flow. Also it had information about the layout, grid struture and other details.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Fboutiques is supposed to be a <strong>flash sales eCommerce store</strong> for fashion products. The overall design rationale behind the design was to create a clean interface and minimalist interface to ensure the product is highlighted even further.</p>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/next-retail-top-image.png" alt="Next Retail store">
              </section>

              <p>Also I <strong>avoided listing</strong> in general as number of products in any event would be less that 20. Also people would like to make sure that switch between the items in any sale should be easy and quick, hence I avoided the listing page.</p>
              <p>The shop was for users having good computer proficiency so the checkout was supposed to be quick, but I added cart details in every step of checkout to <strong>ensure transparency in the entire flow.</strong></p>

              <h3>Design Process</h3>
              <p>Rather than waiting for entire process to complete so that team can view the designs I started the design with only basic idea. Layout, grid structure for some general features I used directly from previous works.</p>

              <p>Created  look and feel of the product before hand rather that going through a detailed design process. It helped us to visualize the product before we even started the development.</p>
              <p>I went through a similar services to find usability flaws within the flows and interface of similar sites. Hence I simplifies listing, yet to ensure that if for any event the sale if the number of products is greater that 20 we might need a listing (highly unlikely).</p>

              <h3>Final UI</h3>
              <p>Finally churned out a deisgns for main flow, also create a prototype in a powerpoint which could be shared with the  stakeholders ahead.</p>
              <p>Also created some mailers and marketing stuff for the store.</p>
